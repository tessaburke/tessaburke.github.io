       <p>My full name is Tessa Delaney Burke and I am a sophomore at Eastern Washington University. I came to Eastern to play on the basketball team and I have loved sports my whole life. I have played many of them including basketball, soccer, and track. I also really love to watch sports, especially football. Along with playing basketball at Eastern, I am studying Visual Communication Design and Construction Management. After graduation I hope to move back to Montana to work in either architecture or interior design, but I hope to eventually go to graduate school. I grew up in Missoula, Montana and I love all things outdoors. Some of my favorite things to do are go to Flathead Lake in Montana, travel the world, and spend time with my family. I also really love food! That is one of the reasons that I love traveling so much, getting to try foods in different cultures is such an amazing experience. My favorite food is breakfast food, which explains my quote!</p>

     <p class="Portfolio">Below are photos of a few of my favorite things. The first photo is of me with a basketball because it was such a huge part of my life for so many years, the second photo is one that I took on a plane while traveling, and the third photo is of me at a cooking class that I took while traveling in Thailand.</p>
