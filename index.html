    <p>My full name is Tessa Delaney Burke and I am a sophomore at Eastern Washington University. I am studying Visual Communication Design and Construction Management. After graduation I hope to work in either architecture or interior design. I grew up in Missoula, Montana and I love all things outdoors. Some of my favorite things to do are go to Flathead Lake in Montana, travel the world, eat food, and play sports. </p>
